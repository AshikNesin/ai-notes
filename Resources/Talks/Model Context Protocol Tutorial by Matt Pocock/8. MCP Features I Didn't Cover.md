There are several MCP features that I chose not to cover in this tutorial.

These features include:

- [Resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources) - the ability for MCP servers to expose data and content for MCP clients to read.
- [Sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/sampling) - allows the MCP server to request completions from the LLM inside the MCP host.

The reason I didn't cover them is that they are not widely supported among the current generation of MCP clients - even among Anthropic's own applications, like Claude Desktop and Claude Code.

Once these parts of the specification have greater real-world utility, I'll cover them in more depth.

But for now, I'm happy with tools and prompts as core MCP primitives.
