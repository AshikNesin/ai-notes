We've discussed so far how to add tools to your MCP server.

But something I haven't seen discussed a lot online is the fact you can use an MCP server to provide prompts to users.

This lets you use MCP as a ==prompt directory== - a collection of prompts that users can pull in to achieve their goals quickly.

I'm going to show you **one of my favorite prompt templates** that I used in the creation of this article.

## The Code

Let's start with our boilerplate code: the server and the transport:

```typescript
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "Prompt Directory",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

// ...more code in here

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

This server is going to house a `cleanTranscription` prompt. I record most of my articles via dictation, and this prompt helps me clean up mistakes in the transcription.

| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1    | Let's start by adding a `prompt` to the server. This has a very similar syntax to `tool`. But instead of `server.tool`, we'll call `server.prompt` | ![[2025-03-16 at 09.10.59@2x.png]] |
| 2    | Next we'll add a description to describe what the tool actually does.                                                                              | ![[2025-03-16 at 09.11.20@2x.png]] |
| 3    | This tool is going to take in the path to the file to clean up. So let's specify that using zod:                                                   | ![[2025-03-16 at 09.11.38@2x.png]] |
| 4    | Finally, we'll add a callback to return the value of the prompt. This comes back in a messages array, with a role of `user` and some text content. | ![[2025-03-16 at 09.11.57@2x.png]] |

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

This means we've added a prompt template called clean transcription to our MCP server.

## The Prompt

For those interested, here is the prompt I use:

```typescript
const getPrompt = (path: string) =>
  \`
Clean up the transcript in the file at ${path}
Do not edit the words,
only the formatting and any incorrect transcriptions.
Turn long-form numbers to short-form:
One hundred and twenty-three -> 123
Three hundred thousand, four hundred and twenty-two -> 300,422
Add punctuation where necessary.
Wrap any references to code in backticks.
Include links as-is - do not modify links.

Common terms:
LLM-as-a-judge
ReAct
Reflexion
RAG
Vercel
\`;
```

There are around two hundred common terms, so I've left them off for brevity.

## The Demo

We can connect to this server from Claude Code using the same technique as [we saw before](https://www.aihero.dev/mcp-server-from-a-single-typescript-file).

When we do, the prompt template is sourced as a command we can run from within Claude. We can access it by typing `/cleanTranscription` within the Claude Code interface. It shows the prompt via autocomplete:

When we run it, we are prompted to add the `path` argument:

![Claude Code asking for the path variable](http://res.cloudinary.com/total-typescript/image/upload/v1741618644/posts/post_k3ou7/johh2yqdfn6jndtvrk0b.png)

And it runs the prompt on the file.

## Conclusion

This is a simple example of how you can use an MCP server as a prompt directory. You can provide your users with a set of prompts that they can use to drive the behavior of their LLM.

This is pretty powerful as a personal productivity tool, and also as a way to provide commands for your MCP clients for often-used workflows.
