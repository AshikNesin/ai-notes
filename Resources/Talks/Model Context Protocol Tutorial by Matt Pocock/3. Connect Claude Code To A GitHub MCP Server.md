Before we get into the abstract details about what MCP is, let's take a look at it working.

I'm a developer and my audience is mostly developers, so let's look at a developer use case.

Let's connect up a GitHub MCP server to Claude Code. Claude Code is a really powerful terminal app for using an LLM to modify a codebase.

I'll walk through the whole demo in the video above, but here are the steps I followed:

1. Install [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview).
2. Get a [GitHub API Key](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) and copy it into my clipboard.
3. Run this command:

```shellscript
claude mcp add
```

1. Add `github-server` as the name of the MCP server.
2. Scope it to the project.
3. Add `npx` as the command.
4. Add `-y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github@latest` as the args.
5. Add `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token-here` for the env.
6. Your MCP server should now be ready to use.
