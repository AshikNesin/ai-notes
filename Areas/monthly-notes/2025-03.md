- AI SDK by Vercel now supports reasoning and MCP clients. MCP is a protocol for connecting your data to AI apps. Zapier is taking a jab at them, and a16z has an MCP market map already.

- → The core MCP team's major accomplishment this week was kicking off a pull request to remove the requirement for remotely connected servers to use server-sent events (SSE). This addresses what many industry leaders considered a mistake: with this change, servers can be stateless. While stateful servers are very much key to MCP's long-term vision, the reality is that most servers today are simpler and effectively stateless. So adding this simplification to the spec is likely to give a massive boost to the adoption of remote MCP servers: a good step closer to nontechnical end-user adoption

## Scratchpad
- My golden rule for production-quality AI-assisted programming is that I won't commit any code to my repository if I couldn't explain exactly what it does to somebody else.
