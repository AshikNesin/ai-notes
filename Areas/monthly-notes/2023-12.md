## Scratchpad
- **Key takeaways from Hassan El Mghari:**
  - Use AI tools to move faster
  - Don't fine-tune or build your own models (specifically for MVP)
  - Use the latest AI models
  - Launch early then iterate
  - Make it open source
  - Make it visually appealing
  - Use whatever tech stack you're comfortable with
  - Build and good things will happen
- **Project Ideas:**
  - Price Prediction UI
  - Image to code
- **Training data quality being crucial for model quality**
- **Used Vertex AI for training with manual verification and correction of bounding boxes**
- **Demo showed confidence level needs to be at least 0.2**
- **Blog ideas:**
  - Text embedding concepts
  - Understanding tokens and tokenization in Large Language Models
- **General Learning Approach:**
  - Build real-world projects while learning theory
  - Write blog posts about projects
  - Document learning journey
  - Advanced topics: prompt engineering, AutoGen, AI security, EU AI Act
