Stripe built a VS Code extension that helps you integrate Stripe payments in your products using AI-written code. It should work with Cursor too (Cursor is a VS Code clone—technically called a “fork”).

AI SDK by Vercel now supports reasoning and MCP clients. MCP is a protocol for connecting your data to AI apps. Zapier is taking a jab at them, and a16z has an MCP market map already.

Deepseek V3 0324 Codes Like a Pro: Deepseek V3 0324 earns praise for its coding skills, rivaling Claude 3.7 Sonnet at a 15x lower cost, despite lacking advanced reasoning capabilities, as shown on HuggingFace.
Despite not being a reasoning model, users recommend giving V3 0324 a chance, highlighting its strong performance on rote tasks and mathematical problems.

→ The core MCP team's major accomplishment this week was kicking off a pull request to remove the requirement for remotely connected servers to use server-sent events (SSE). This addresses what many industry leaders considered a mistake: with this change, servers can be stateless. While stateful servers are very much key to MCP's long-term vision, the reality is that most servers today are simpler and effectively stateless. So adding this simplification to the spec is likely to give a massive boost to the adoption of remote MCP servers: a good step closer to nontechnical end-user adoption
