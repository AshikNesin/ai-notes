 As a result almost every piece of (non vibe-coding) code I work on has pretty comprehensive test coverage.
 
This massively derisks my use of LLMs. If an LLM writes weird, convoluted code that solves my problem I can prove that it works with tests - and then have it refactor the code until it looks good to me, keeping the tests green the whole time.
