# 2024: The Year LLMs Grew Up (and Got Cheaper)

Remember when ChatGPT felt like magic? 2024 changed everything. Let's break down what happened in simple terms.

## The Big Story: Power to the People

GPT-4 was the gold standard in 2023. Now? Over 18 companies have matched or beaten it. Even better - some of these models can run on your laptop. Yes, really.

## Your AI Got Way Cheaper

Remember paying $30 for a million tokens? Now you're looking at cents. Google's cheapest model costs 97% less than last year's GPT-3.5. Processing 68,000 photos now costs less than a coffee.

## Cool New Tricks

- Talk to your AI? Check.
- Show it pictures? Yep.
- Point your camera at things and chat about them? That too.
- Build apps by just describing them? Absolutely.

## Not All Sunshine

Sure, the tech got better. But:

- Using these tools effectively is still tricky
- The best models are moving behind expensive paywalls
- "AI agents" are still more hype than reality
- Most people have no idea what these tools can actually do

## Looking Forward

The field is moving at breakneck speed. The gap between what's possible and what most people know about is growing. We've solved some old problems (cost, basic capabilities) but found new ones (infrastructure impact, accessibility).

Bottom line? AI tools in 2024 became more powerful, cheaper, and more accessible - but they're still not quite ready for the mainstream. The real question for 2025: Can we make them as easy to use as they are powerful?
