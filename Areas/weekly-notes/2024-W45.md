With low latency, improved instruction following, and more accurate tool use, Claude 3.5 Haiku is well suited for user-facing products, specialized sub-agent tasks, and generating personalized experiences from huge volumes of data—like purchase history, pricing, or inventory records.

Claude 3.5 Haiku will be made available later this month across our first-party API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI—initially as a text-only model and with image input to follow

Prompt caching (Beta): Cache frequently used context to reduce costs by up to 90% and latency by up to 85% for long prompts.
Message Batches API (Beta): Send batches of up to 10,000 queries per batch. Batches are often processed in less than two hours and cost 50% less than standard API calls

Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Haiku today, a few days later than expected (they said it would be out by the end of October).

I was expecting this to be a complete replacement for their existing Claude 3 Haiku model, in the same way that Claude 3.5 Sonnet eclipsed the existing Claude 3 Sonnet while maintaining the same pricing.

Claude 3.5 Haiku is different. First, it doesn't (yet) support image inputs - so Claude 3 Haiku remains the least expensive Anthropic model for handling those.

Secondly, it's not priced the same as the previous Haiku. That was $0.25/million input and $1.25/million for output - the new 3.5 Haiku is 4x that at $1/million input and $5/million output.
