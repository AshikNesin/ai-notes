## Scratchpad
- DeepSeek-V2.5 open-source 
- From copilots to agents to employees
	- Another key shift is the move from generic AI assistants toward industry- and task-specific AI "agents" that aim to automate entire job functions. While some startups are still using "copilot" as a buzzword, clearly the name of the game is now "agents."
	- The promise is that these AI agents can handle 80%+ of the repetitive, predictable parts of the role by fetching relevant information, drafting emails and documents, updating systems of record, and engaging in dialog. This would allow human workers to focus on higher-level strategy, edge cases, and relationship building.
	-  Reliably embodying an "AI employee" is going to be extremely difficult, but seems to be the current pitch to investors.
