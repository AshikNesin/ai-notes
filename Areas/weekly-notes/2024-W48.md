	- - Instead of creating custom integrations for each data source, developers can now [**use MCP as a universal connector**](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol?utm_source=bensbites&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=bb-digest-ai-s-all-access-pass) between AI assistants and tools/databases. It’s only local on your machine for now. Feels a little like GPT actions from OpenAI. But I’ll be interested to see if this could turn into as big of a deal as it could be (ai tools spin up mini tools in minutes, connect to anywhere with an api…)
