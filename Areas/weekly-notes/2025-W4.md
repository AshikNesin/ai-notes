- Berkeley's Sky Computing lab [released Sky-T1-32B-Preview](https://x.com/NovaSkyAI/status/1877793041957933347), a finetune of Qwen 2.5 32B ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-o1-destroys-lmsys-arena-qwen-25-kyutai/)) with 17k rows of training data from QwQ-32B ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-qwen-with-questions-32b-open-weights/)) + [rewriting traces with gpt-4o-mini + rejection sampling](https://x.com/TrelisResearch/status/1879530546038022623), **all done for $450**. Because QwQ outperforms o1-preview, distilling from QwQ brings Qwen up to **match** o1-preview's benchmarks:
