# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal knowledge management repository for AI/ML learning notes and resources, organized using the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives). The repository contains:

- **AIEngineerGuide/**: Blog content and scratchpad for AI engineering topics
- **Areas/**: Ongoing notes including journals, weekly notes, and monthly notes  
- **Resources/**: Reference materials, concepts, tools, and clippings
- **Projects/**: Active learning materials like books and courses
- **Archives/**: Historical templates and backup files

## Repository Structure

### Key Directories
- `AIEngineerGuide/content/blog/`: Organized blog posts by year/month (2024-01 through 2025-07)
- `Areas/journals/`: Daily journal entries with dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `Areas/weekly-notes/`: Weekly notes in YYYY-WXX format
- `Resources/`: Contains concepts, tools, people, talks, papers, and bookmark collections
- `Resources/assets/`: Screenshots and images referenced in notes

### Content Organization
- Blog posts are organized chronologically by year and month
- Journal entries follow a consistent date format
- Resource materials are categorized by type (concepts, tools, people, etc.)
- All content is in Markdown format

## File Management Guidelines

- This is a notes/documentation repository - no code compilation or build processes
- Files are primarily Markdown (.md) with some PDF and image assets
- Content follows a structured naming convention with dates and descriptive titles
- The repository uses git for version control but has no CI/CD or deployment processes

## Common Tasks

Since this is a documentation repository, typical tasks include:
- Adding new blog posts to the appropriate year/month directory
- Creating new journal entries with proper date formatting
- Organizing resources and reference materials
- Managing screenshots and assets in the Resources/assets/ directory

## Notes

- No package.json, build scripts, or development dependencies found
- This is a pure content repository focused on AI/ML learning documentation
- Uses Obsidian and Logseq for note management (as mentioned in README)
- Inspired by Swyx's AI Notes repository structure
