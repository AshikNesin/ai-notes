Bolt is a browser-based development platform that's pretty wild. It turns your words into working React apps. You just describe what you want, and boom â€“ you've got a full-stack application right in your browser. No need to set up a local environment or fiddle with complicated tools. It's got some neat tricks: real-time preview as you work, automated debugging, and one-click deployment to places like Netlify. You can go from idea to live app without ever leaving your browser.
