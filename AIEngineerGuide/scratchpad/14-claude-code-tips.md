## YOLO Mode
By default, claude code will ask lots of questions like can I edit this file? Run that? (basic bash commands), etc

Well, this was indended for good use case of keeping human in the loop.

But it might be overkill for side project or something.

For such cases you can run claude with skip permission flag

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

It is similar to YOLO mode in cursor

Disclaimer: There is a minor risk that rouge agent might run some unintent commands. But for the brave ones (or the ones that are running Claude code in safe environment like Docker) `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is a huge time saver.

## Code Review

`/install-github-app` command

`claude-code-review.yml` file


```yml
direct_prompt: |
	Please review this pull request and look for bugs and security issues.
	Only report on bugs and potential vulnerabilities you find. Be concise.
```

Default behaviour is it is too verbose. The above prompt make it more concise.
