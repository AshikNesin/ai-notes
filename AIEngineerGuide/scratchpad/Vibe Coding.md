### 👀 What caught my eye… vibe coding games

If you’re on Twitter, you have likely seen this. Pieter Levels (@levelsio) has been building a game coded mostly using AI. It started as a fun project, soon Levels started selling ads on the game space (planets, planes and blimps), alreadying amounting to $50k+ revenue.

This has again got people talking about “Oh, that’s not how game development works”, “AI coding is not secure”, “Soon, the codebase will be a mess that no one can understand”, and more. But it’s again missing the key point that a) it works and generates revenue—the key goal and b) all other things are also sovable by AI.

Ask AI to fix vulnerabilities, ask it to break down the code into smaller parts, ask it to add new features. If you get stuck, ask for help from others. Just get working (vs comparing and complaining)
