Like how AI is the talk of the town, couple of years ago it was **No Code**. 

People were excited that they could build applications without having to depend on a developer.

As long as they know the requirements, they can leverage platforms like [Bubble](https://bubble.io/) and build a good enough application in almost a day. In fact, I saw a couple of people building SaaS applications using those platforms as well.

Like I said before, it was good enough but if you've to do custom changes on top of it (which is not supported in the platform) then you are all on your own.

Similar to the platforms, nowadays I'm seeing more and AI based app generator apps like [bolt.new](https://bolt.new) or [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) where you can just mention what you want to build and it builds the app almost instantly.

On top of the generated apps, you can suggest some changes by chatting and if everything is good then you can directly deploy it.

But similar to No Code, it helps to do the prototype or PoC almost instantly but making changes on top of it and getting the app to production might not be seem (at least for now)

**What's the takeaway?**

Leverage the tools, but beware of the tradeoff.
