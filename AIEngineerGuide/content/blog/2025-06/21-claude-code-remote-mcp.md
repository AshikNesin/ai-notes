By now, almost everyone who is using AI for code generation should be aware of [**Claude Code** ](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)â€” an awesome CLI-based agentic code generation tool.

Iâ€™ve tried it a couple of times recently and Iâ€™m really impressed with the results ðŸ™Œ

**[Remote MCP](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/remote-mcp-servers) is now supported.**

Which means you can now integrate your tools easily with Claude Code.

Just imagine â€” you say a query like _"Fix bug-x"_, and it fetches the bug details from Sentry (or your bug reporting app) and addresses it.

How cool is that? ðŸ¤¯
