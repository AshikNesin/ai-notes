Cloudflare has recently open sources their [LLM Playground](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/)

You can use the playground to test the models that they've in their platform and it also has support for remote MCP.

It takes care of lot of things out of box:
- OAuth
- Streamable HTTP and Server-Sent Events transport methods
- Bearer token authentication

Just a simple UI that does the job really well 👇
