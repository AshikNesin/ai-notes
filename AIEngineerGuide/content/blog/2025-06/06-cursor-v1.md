[Cursor](https://cursor.com) has released v1 ðŸ¥³

Here are the some of highlights that I found interesting

## BugBot
-  AI code review for pull requests.
-  Usage based billing.
- Oddly, it looks like a clone of CodeRabbit.

## Memories
With Memories, Cursor can remember facts from conversations and reference them in the future. 

Memories are stored per project on an individual level, and can be managed from Settings.
