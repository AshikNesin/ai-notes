With all the buzz around AI. Getting started with AI Engineering feels overwhelming ðŸ¤¯

Even if you try to look into YouTube or some random blogs, there are lots of hype-driven recommendations which might not be ideal if you're planning to get better by understanding the fundamentals, what it is good at and what it is not good (yet), etc.

You might even be planning to pivot your career into AI Engineering full-time.

So here are some of my recommendations to get you started. Good luck!
