There are lots of coding agents out there at the moment. 

You just assign a task to it. It'll plan, research, build, test, etc as if a software engineer was doing it (at least for easy to medium level complexity)

Here is a leaderboard of the top AI Coding Agents based on the info that is available in  public GitHub - Draft PR created, PR merged, PR closed, etc.

You can check it out here: https://prarena.ai

## Data Source
Intestinally, it is just a GitHub search queries.

Based on the branch prefix or git author that is specific to an AI Coding agent it gets the metrics and updates in the website regularly.
