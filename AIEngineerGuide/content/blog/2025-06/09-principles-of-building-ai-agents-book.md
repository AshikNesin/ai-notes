Once you share your email address, you'll receive a link to download the book as a PDF. 

Here are some heads-ups:
- The pdf layout is a little hard to read. 
- The examples are primarily built using Mastra (obviously!), but he has covered concepts that you can apply in any language or framework.

Overall, it's a short (but insightful) book which you can read quickly! 

Happy learning AI!
