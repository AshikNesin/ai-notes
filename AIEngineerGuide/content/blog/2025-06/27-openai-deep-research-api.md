OpenAI has recently released [deep research](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/deep-research) models as API.

Generally, deep research are most advanced models that is designed to solve more complex problem. It has access to the internet, synthesize the data across websites, you can even bring in your own logic by using MCP servers, run code (using Code Interpreter), etc.

Those models power the **deep research in ChatGPT**

One thing to keep in mind though is they to too much time though. 

Until recently, the models were only available in ChatGPT but now they're making it available via API as well.
