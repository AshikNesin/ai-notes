I came across this really good tutorial by Microsoft about building MCP Servers.

It covers from basics to advanced stuffs like OAuth, Streaming, Security, etc.

And the best part is, unlike other tutorials there is a hands-on examples across multiple programming languages like C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript.

Here you go ðŸ‘‡

Happy building MCP-servers!
