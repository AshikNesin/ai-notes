Anthropic has recently launched VS Code extention for Claude Code

While interacting with Claude Code in terminal, this extension acts as a compliment to Claude Code CLI.

At the moment, it has support for the following:
- **Selection context**: Selected text gets automatically added as context
- **Diff viewing**: Use VS Code diff view to view your changes
	- Note: Make sure to set diff tool to **auto** in /config command to enable the integration
- **Tab awareness**: Claude can see which files you have open in the editor
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Support for shortcuts to push selected code into Claudeâ€™s prompt

To be honest, these features are pretty simple one and I believe it is more of like baseline rather than a solid state.
