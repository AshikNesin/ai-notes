I recently came across [app.build](https://www.app.build/) - It's an open-source AI Agent built by [Neon](https://neon.com/).

I haven't played around with it yet but it looks like a good reference if you're building AI Agents.

And their blog post covers high level design as well ðŸ‘‡

## Will I use this?
I see this as a push from them with the goal of making people other Neon products like database. There is nothing wrong in it. 

But I don't find any compiling reason to switch to this than my current workflow.

However, like I said before it seems like a good reference for building AI Agents
