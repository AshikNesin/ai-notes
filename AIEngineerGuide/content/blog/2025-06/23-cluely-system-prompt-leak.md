I came across this prompt leak of [Cluely](https://cluely.com/) by Jack Cable (apparently it is exposed in their desktop source code)

Here is the system prompt for both default and also enterprise versions

Fun fact: The founders initially have built [tool](https://www.interviewcoder.co/) that helps to answer leetcode questions [undetected](https://www.interviewcoder.co/still_working) ðŸ˜œ

## Disclaimer
I'm not sure if it's 100% correct. I saw this in Twitter and bookmarking here in the blog for future reference.
