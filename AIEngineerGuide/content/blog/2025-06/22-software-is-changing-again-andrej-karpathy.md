> Be fluent in all of them -- they all have slight pros and cons. You might want to program something in 1.0, 2.0 or 3.0

> Lot of software will become partially autonomous

How are you going to make product & services partially autonomous?

Can a LLM see everything that a human can see?
Can an LLM act in the way the human act?
Can a human supervise and stay in the loop of the activity?

![[2025-06-22 at 19.34.28@2x.png]]

Most of the softwares are built for human -> all the sliders, button, etc. All of these has to be accessible to the LLMs

Speed up the loop (in our interest)

Self driving, in 2015 - he had a perfect drive (think of demo)

Even now 2025, weâ€™re still working on making self driving perfect.

Software is same as this.

2025 is year of agents - Not yet.

Partial autonomy product.
