LLMs such as Claude 4, GPT-4o, and Llama come from various providers, each having their own billing systems (typically credit-based), separate API keys, and individual setups.

While sticking with one provider like OpenAI or Anthropic might seem easier, it limits your flexibility, like performing A/B tests across different AI models. 

Additionally, dependency on a single provider could leave your application vulnerable if the provider experiences downtime/degradation.

They go down, you go down ðŸ˜œ

On the other hand, choosing multiple providers comes with it's own challenges like:
- Setting up individual accounts with each provider.
- Managing credits independently.
- Generating separate API keys.
- Handling multiple SDK integrations within your application.

[OpenRouter.ai](https://OpenRouter.ai) solves these challenges by acting as a unified API gateway.

### Single API, Multiple LLM models
With OpenRouter, all you need is a single account and one credit management system to seamlessly access multiple models.

Hereâ€™s an example:
```shell
curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life?" }]
  }'
```

If you want to use a [different LLM model](https://openrouter.ai/models), simply change the `model` parameter.

Here are TLDR version of what are all the other things that you get from it as well:
- Unified Billing & Analytics
- [Automatic Fallback](https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/provider-routing)
- OpenAI-Compatible Tooling
- [Key Provisioning & Rotation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/provisioning-api-keys)
- Bring Your Own Key - BYOKâ€”with a 5% markup charged from your credits.

## Integrate with OpenAI-Compatible SDK

Integration is straightforward

Just change the base URL in your SDK configuration:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
  base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
  api_key="<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>",
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="openai/gpt-4o",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
    }
  ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)

```
