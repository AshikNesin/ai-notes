I recently came across [MCPJam](https://www.mcpjam.com/)

**What does MCP Jam does?**
Pretty much everything that you need to test a MCP server

Whether you want to test stdio/remote server or want to use local LLM using Ollama. 

It got you covered.

And the best part is it is [open source](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector)
## How to get started?

```shell
npx @mcpjam/inspector@latest
```

And that'll will start the server in port 3000 by default

If you want to start it in different port then pass `--port`  argument with the desired port number

Once it starts, you can add your MCP server. It has support for both stdio and HTTP transport.

Once you've connected your tool you can test your tools/resources/prompts within the browser itself.

## Playground
You can use the playground feature to test the things like a actual usage. 

Out of box, it'll support Ollama models. And you can also bring in your own OpenAI or Anthropic keys as well.

I really like this playground feature. And the UI looks so slick as well.

Happy testing MCP!
