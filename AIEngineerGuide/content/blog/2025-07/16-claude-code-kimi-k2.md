[Kimi K2](https://moonshotai.github.io/Kimi-K2/) model which was released recently by Moon shot AI recently had Deepseak moment.

It's the open source non-thinking model that is scoring good in online benchmarks

You can think of this similar to Anthropic Claude 3.5

Token usage adds up fast for AI agents so for the task that requires **less intelligence** you can consider using models like Kimi K2 especially if you're using agentic tools like Claude code.

You can get their hosted version directly from them or using Open Router / Groq

Their hosted version is 80% times cheaper than Anthropic.
## How to do it?

Just set these environment variables before running Claude Code cli

```shell
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=YOUR_MOONSHOT_API
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.moonshot.ai/anthropic
```

And now, you can start claude code as usual

```shell
claude
```

Happy cost optimization!
