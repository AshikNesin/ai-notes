With AI tools like ChatGPT becoming common things, we're seeing lot of AI generated content (and yeah, AI slops as well).

And it is hard to know whether something is written by a human or an AI.

I came across [AI Content Detector](https://quillbot.com/ai-content-detector)  tool by QuillBot.

Basically what it does it uses ML under the hood to figure out the probability of whether the given content is written by a human or not.

And like with anything in ML/AI, it is not 100% accurate and should not be used as final source of truth.

Note: After couple of times, they'll ask you to login to the tool to use it.

Happy writing content!
