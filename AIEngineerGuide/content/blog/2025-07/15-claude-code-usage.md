Getting aggregated usage cost in Claude Code is not straight forward.

However, all the interaction that you do with Claude Code is stored in `~/.claude/` directory which also includes date, model used, token usage, etc.

With these information we can get the high level overview of it.

You can also use [ccusage - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ccusage) to get a really good report in a nice format 

```shell
npx ccusage@latest
```

This is especially useful if you do not have access to view those information in Anthropic console.

You can checkout their docs to learn more about the filters supported in ccusage

Happy measuring cost!
