Claude Code now supports **custom hooks**  ðŸŒŸ

## What are hooks?
This feature allows us to register **shell commands** during Claude Codeâ€™s lifecycle.

A good analogy would be it is something similar to Git hooks. 

It provides **deterministic control** over Claude Codeâ€™s behavior instead of relying on the LLM

For example, running automated code formatting whenever a file is changed.

And here are some of the other use cases that are mentioned in their docs

## How to get started?
Anthropic has a detailed doc about how to configure, test, examples, etc.

Checkout their docs for more details on this ðŸ‘‰ http://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks

Happy wiring hooks!
