Claude Code now supports **custom slash commands** ðŸŒŸ

Basically, you can think of custom slash commands as a common prompts that you use with Claude Code regularly.

Here are some of the other interesting things about it:
- Store the prompts in a markdown file.
- Has support for namespacing through directory structures.
- Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal)

## Command Types

### Project commands
Commands (prompts) are stored in your repo so that you can share it with teams.

**Location**:Â `.claude/commands/`  
**Prefix**:Â `/project:`

In the following example, we create theÂ `/project:optimize`Â command:
```bash
# Create a project command
mkdir -p .claude/commands
echo "Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md

```
### Personal commands
Commands available across all your projects.

**Location**:Â `~/.claude/commands/`  
**Prefix**:Â `/user:`

```sh
# Create a personal command
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities:" > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
```
## Features
####  Namespacing
Just place the commands in a subdirectories.
Organize commands in subdirectories to create namespaced commands.

**Structure**:Â `<prefix>:<namespace>:<command>`

For example, a file atÂ `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md`Â creates the commandÂ `/project:frontend:component`

### Arguments
Pass dynamic values to commands using theÂ `$ARGUMENTS`Â placeholder.

Here is an example command ðŸ‘‡
