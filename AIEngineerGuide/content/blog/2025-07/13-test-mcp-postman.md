When I'm building MCP servers I usually use official [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector#mcp-inspector) then I came to know that [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) supports it out of box.

So for any quick testing, I started using it.

You won't be getting latest stuffs that are added to MCP spec but Postman has covered the things that you'll need 90% of the time :) 

## Getting Started

When you click on "New" (Cmd + N), you should be seeing MCP as one of the option. Select it.

Now choose the transport that you want to test like `stdio` or `HTTP` based

Then type in the command to connect.

Once you're done you should be seeing the tools that are available for you in that MCP.

It supports auth as well

Happy testing MCP!
