Like the unix principle - Do one thing, do it well.

If an AI agent has to do only one task, it does the work really well.

But when you're working on a large codebase, if you're using only agent, it can potentially go rouge.

That's where **Sub agents** feature in Claude Code comes in.

## What are sub agents?
It is a **custom** agents that you can invoke to perform certain task.

You can configure it based on your needs - system prompts, tools, etc.

And the best part is it has a **separate context window**.

## What the benefits of using it?

## How to get started?

Run the following command in claude code

```bash
/agents
```

Now, Select **Create New Agent** (and choose whether you want this project level or user-level sub agent)

Then, define the sub agent. 

Let claude generate the first draft for your sub agent. You can make changes on top of it.

You can use the [available](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings#tools-available-to-claude) build in tools for your custom sub agent.

## Where is the sub agents are stored?

It's markdown file stored in the following places

| Type                   | Location            | Scope                         | Priority |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- |
| **Project sub agents** | `.claude/agents/`   | Available in current project  | Highest  |
| **User sub agents**    | `~/.claude/agents/` | Available across all projects | Lower    |

## Example 

Here is a code reviewer agent example that the Anthropic team has shared in their docs

```md

tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
---

You are a senior code reviewer ensuring high standards of code quality and security.

When invoked:
1. Run git diff to see recent changes
2. Focus on modified files
3. Begin review immediately

Review checklist:
- Code is simple and readable
- Functions and variables are well-named
- No duplicated code
- Proper error handling
- No exposed secrets or API keys
- Input validation implemented
- Good test coverage
- Performance considerations addressed

Provide feedback organized by priority:
- Critical issues (must fix)
- Warnings (should fix)
- Suggestions (consider improving)

Include specific examples of how to fix issues.
```
