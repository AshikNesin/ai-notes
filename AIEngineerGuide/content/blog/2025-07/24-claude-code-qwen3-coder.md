Alibaba team has recently released [Qwen3-Coder](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-coder/) which claims to do better in coding. Based on the benchmark it is in the range of Claude 4 in term of accuracy.

Let's see how to use this model with Claude Code.

First, you'll need to get API key from Â [Alibaba Cloud Model Studio](https://modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com/) 

If you don't have claude code installed in your machine before then install it 

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Once you've that, then set these in env variables
```shell
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/api/v2/apps/claude-code-proxy
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=your-api-key
```

That's pretty much it. You should be using Claude Code with Qwen3-Coder.
