Z.AI has released [GLM-4.5](https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.5) which is an open source (open model) primarily built for  agent-oriented apps.

It is as good as commercial models.

Similar to [Kimi K2](/blog/claude-code-kimi-k2/), they also provide Anthropic compatible API endpoint which we can use with Claude Code
## How to do it?

Just set these environment variables before running Claude Code cli

```shell
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=YOUR_MOONSHOT_API
```

And now, you can start claude code as usual

```shell
claude
```

## How to get API Key?

Go to https://z.ai/model-api

Login with you z.ai account (same as z.ai chat account)

They don't offer any free credits so you'll need to add some money to try out their API endpoint.

Happy cost optimization!
