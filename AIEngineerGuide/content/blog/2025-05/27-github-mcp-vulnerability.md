[GitHub MCP](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) gives full access to your GitHub repos (including private repo), ability to read/write issues, PR, etc

## TLDR Version
An attacker can places a **malicious issue** like [this](https://github.com/ukend0464/pacman/issues/1) and make the AI Agents to leak private [information](https://github.com/ukend0464/pacman/pull/2/files)

## How does it work?
1. An attacker will create a malicious prompt as issue in a public repo
2. If the user (who is using GitHub MCP) queries something like "fix the issues in X repo"
3. The malicious prompt gets triggered, which in turn executes other actions like reading content from private repo without the user's knowledge (assumption: ‚ÄúAlways Allow‚Äù  confirmation or similar policy is configured)
4. Then the information gets leaked in public repo üôà

## Lesson
When using/building/experimenting with  MCP, we need to be mindful of the attack like this and try to reduce the potential vulnerabilities
