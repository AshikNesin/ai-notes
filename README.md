> Notes on learning AI from Scratch in Public

I try to dump all the things that I find interesting, my roadmap, learning, etc

Most of the content might be raw/unpolished though but I hope is helpful for someone who is starting the AI journey

## Why Am I doing this?
I want to learn & build GenAI AI apps.

Not just yet another GPT wrapper app by calling some API provided by OpenAI without understand its fundamentals.

I want to understand its actual benefits and tradeoffs and build apps that solves the real problem.

TLDR: Build things with AI rather than consume it
