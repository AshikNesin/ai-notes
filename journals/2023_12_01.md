- DONE Training Your Own AI Model Is Not As Hard As You (Probably) Think
  {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCUkvL0mbxI&ab_channel=Steve(Builder.io)}}
	- {{youtube-timestamp 302}} They've crawled the public data (headless browser) and identified the where to images are and it's ==bounding boxes== are with Javascript and used as training data.
	- {{youtube-timestamp 320}} Quality of your model is entirely dependent of quality of your training data. The team has manually verified and corrected bounding boxes of the images.
	- {{youtube-timestamp 356}} They've used **Vertex AI**. It costs money though but training on local machine is also possible.
	- {{youtube-timestamp 451}} Demo of it. Confidence level needs to be at-least 0.2

	- Take Aways
		- Use AI tools to move faster
		- Don't fine-tune or build your own models (specifically for MVP)
		- Don't finetune or build your own models
		- Use the latest Al models
		- Launch early then iterate
		- Make it open source
		- Make it look visually appealing

		- Use whatever tech stack that you're comfortable
		- Build and good things will happen
