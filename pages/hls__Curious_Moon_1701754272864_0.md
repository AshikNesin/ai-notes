- You do what we all did: learn what you need to as you go, Googling and reading blog posts, exploring whatâ€™s possible and eventually becoming intoxicated on the power of data and the database.

- `which psql` -> location of the Postgres binaries
- `createdb`, `dropdb` and other things are located in that directory as well
	- `createdb db_name` -> for creating
	- Need to be extra careful with `dropdb` as it does not asks for confirmation when running it and it's quite easy to nuke it
- `psql postgres` (psql installed via brew)
	- `\?` -> help
	- `\c db_name` -> for connecting
	- Creating a table
		- ```sql
		  DROP TABLE if exists master_plan;
		  CREATE TABLE master_plan(
		    id serial primary key,
		    the_date date, 
		    title varchar(100),
		    description text
		  );
		  -- CREATE TABLE
		  ```
		- psql wraps the current command if you hit return, unless a line terminator is present, in which case it executes the command.

		- **serial primary key** is not a valid SQL. It's a psql shortcut
			- Alternative in ANSI SQL
				- ```sql

	- Deleting a table
		- ```sql

		  -- DROP TABLE
